# Number Guessing Game in C++

This is a simple number guessing game, written in C++, that allows the user to guess a random number generated by the computer. The user has several attempts to guess the correct number, and after each attempt, the game will indicate whether the number entered is too high or too low.

## How to play

1. At the start of the game, the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100 (or any other defined range).
2. The player enters a number in an attempt to guess the one generated by the computer.
3. If the number entered is too high or too low, the game will give a corresponding hint.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or until the attempts are finished.

## Educational Purpose

This game is ideal for those who want to improve their C++ programming skills. It is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice control structures, loops, functions and random number generation. It's unique and fun for beginners and provides a solid foundation for understanding fundamental programming concepts.

## How to get started

To run the game, clone the repository and compile the source code using a C++ compiler such as CLion or CodeBlocks.
